			WildeKey is a 2D educational game hosted on the web created with the design goal to make learning to type fun. 
			Players go world to world, unlocking more of the keyboard to practice as they move across levels.
			Levels comprise of two types, wave based typing in lanes and boss fights.
			In the first, waves of creatures appear for the player to save by typing their displayed text while switching between lanes.
			Against bosses, players instead take a more formal word per minute test where they use the unlocked portion of the keyboard and type out a paragraph to defeat the boss.
			Assuming the role of a wildebeest wizard, the player progresses through color-saturated cartooney environments engaging a wide range of creatures perfect for elementary school students.<br>
			<br>
			Created to integrate into Sandy Spring Friends School cirriculum, our team composing of two developers and one mentor worked on this project for 9 months.
			Our project had an emphasis on implementing a strong development plan, using story-boarding and a Gantt Chart.<br>
			My role in this project was as a:<br>
			- designer, coming up with the initial idea when reflecting on how boring learning to type was when I was a child.<br>
			- artist, drawing all the games creatures, bosses, world-map tiles, and backgrounds. <br>
			- programmer, creating all scripts and systems for a world map, typing in the lane-based and paragraph based approaches, and using scriptable objects to make creatures a datatype.<br>
