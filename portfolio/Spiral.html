		<p>
			Project Spiral is a boss rush game where an extermination job goes awry after a wizard's spell transforms a small creature into a progressively stronger foe. 
			Each time the boss is defeated, it transforms, challenging the player further.
			<br><br>
			Spiral's gameplay consists of a series of boss fights. 
			After each victory, players can build their character by either refilling health or selecting a new item. 
			Items can replace primary or secondary attacks or offer passive effects, encouraging diverse playstyles based on item combinations.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Using Spiral Development</h3>
		<p>
			Project Spiral is developed using the spiral development methodology, where each build, or “spiral,” is a feature-complete version of the game with closed game-loops. 
			Each iteration builds on the previous, expanding content and features while keeping the game playable from start to finish.
			<br><br>
			This iterative approach helps manage scope effectively, ensuring a technically complete experience at the end of every spiral. In effect, this means no matter when time or money runs out, the game is complete.
			<br><br>
			To track progress, we use a three-number build system:
		</p>
		<div class="columns">
			<div class="colx2">
					<ul>Major Version: State of the game (eg 0 for pre-release)</ul>
					<ul>Spiral Number: Current iteration of content and feature expansion</ul>
					<ul>Patch Number: Bug fixes and refinements after a spiral</ul>
			</div>

		<h3>Content Development & Reuse</h3>
		<p>
			A key example of our content reuse strategy is the Basilisk boss and the Grappling Hook item. 
			The Basilisk was designed to create a hazardous battlefield by placing permanent hitboxes and using a tongue attack to drag the player into danger.
			<br><br>
			The tongue attack was implemented with a custom LineRenderer script, interpolating points between the Basilisk's mouth and the player’s position, visualized using Unity’s LineRenderer component. 
			Recognizing the reusability of this mechanic, I adapted it into a Grappling Hook item, allowing the player to pull themselves toward any point on the screen.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Procedural Animation</h3>
		<p>
			To reduce our art workload with a team of 4 programmers and 1 audio specialist, I proposed and developed a procedural animation system as a code-driven alternative to traditional keyframed animation. 
			This system drives both player and enemy animations, requiring only 3D models—no rigs or keyframes necessary.
			<br><br>
			The system uses a custom Inverse Kinematics (IK) script controlling limb positions through a 3-point structure (shoulder, elbow, hand for arms and thigh, knee, foot for legs).
			<ul>Arms: Automatically adjust stance and item-holding position</ul>
			<ul>Legs: A seperate LegStepper script calculates foot placement based on character movement, ensuring dynamic motion.</ul>
