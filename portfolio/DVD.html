		<h3>ABOUT</h3>
		<p>
			In Dodge Veer Dash you assume the role of a platformer character able to run around, wall-jump, and pick up disks.
			Using disks, the player is able to dash in any direction.
			The goal is to avoid the bouncing DVD logo or to slam it into the corners using dash (with enough skill). 
			This game was made in 24 non-consecutive hours as part of a game jam.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Creating a Modern 2D Platformer Controller</h3>
		<p>
			A big part of this project was creating a modern platformer character.
			To do this, I adjusted gravity when at the apex of the jump to make it more responsive.
			I also supported variable jump heights based on how long the button is held.
			Using the same system for regular jumping, I created wall jumps as well.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Squash & Stretch</h3>
		<p>
			The character is a single sprite and doesn't include any animations.
			However, by using squash & stretch to scale the size of the image on certain actions the character feels alive.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Particle Effects</h3>
		<p>
			The character has two major particle effects, one for jumping up where the particles charge into the player and the other on landing where those particles release into the ground.
			These two particle effects instantly increased the juice of the game.
		</p>

		<h3>Remaking the bouncing DVD logo</h3>
		<div class="columns">
			<div class="colx2">
				<p>
					As the game centers around the DVD logo, I had to make it work as it does typically.
					This includes bouncing off walls properly, hitting the corners, and changing colors each collision.
					I also added support for redirecting the DVD logo when slamming into it with the dash.

		<h3>Creating gameplay borders from the viewport size</h3>
		<p>
			Since the game uses the camera's bounds as the playspace, I decided to dynamically create the gameplay hitbox that controls the games bounds.
			I programmatically create an EdgeCollider with 4 points from the camera viewport's dimensions, allowing this game to be played in any aspect ratio.
